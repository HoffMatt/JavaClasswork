scanner class
    scanner is a class that helps us take input data from the keyboard.
    just like scanner class, we have so many other classes that we can use from java and other libraries.
    These classes are divided into methods. Each method can do something useful. like;
    nextInt(), nextBoolean(), nextDouble90.
    Important Note:
        Every class in java also acts as a data type. We can create variables of these classes.

Logical operators:
    Logical operators are used to combine multiple conditions. There are three logical operators in Java
    1) Logical NOT "!"
    2) Logical OR "||"
